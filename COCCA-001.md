# COCCA-001 — Compliance and Auditing Overview Implementation Plan

**Question Reference:** COCCA-001

**Question:**
Describe the methodology and process used to perform discovery of customer compliance requirements, identify stakeholders with defined roles and responsibilities, and establish the actions and periodic audit processes required for maintaining compliance posture.

---

## Conceptual Understanding

Compliance and auditing form the backbone of secure, regulated cloud operations. Organizations operate under various compliance frameworks—from industry standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA to regional regulations like GDPR—each with unique requirements and audit expectations.

The challenge isn't just meeting these standards initially, but maintaining compliance continuously as infrastructure evolves, regulations change, and new stakeholders join the environment.

**This implementation plan addresses three core pillars:**

1. **Discovery & Assessment** — Understanding current compliance obligations and existing posture
2. **Stakeholder Governance** — Defining clear ownership through roles and responsibility matrices  
3. **Audit Lifecycle** — Establishing repeatable internal and external audit processes

The methodology outlined here leverages AWS native services (AWS Audit Manager, AWS Config, CloudTrail) alongside documentation frameworks to create a living compliance program that scales with organizational growth.
