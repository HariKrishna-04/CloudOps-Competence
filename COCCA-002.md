**Risk Identification, Quantification, and Management Implementation Plan**

**Question Reference:** COCCA-002

**Question:**

Identify, quantify, and manage risks relating to technology and business needs. The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to identify and quantify:
- Operational risks relating to infrastructure availability, reliability, security and performance and
- Business risks relating to reputation and ability to respond to changing marketing conditions.
- And define how to mitigate the risk for any gaps identified.

## Conceptual Understanding

Risk management in cloud environments represents a critical capability that extends beyond traditional IT risk frameworks. Organizations operating on AWS face a dynamic risk landscape that encompasses operational, business, compliance, and strategic dimensions. Unlike static on-premises environments, cloud infrastructure introduces new risk vectors while simultaneously providing powerful tools for risk mitigation.

Effective risk management is not a one-time assessment but a continuous cycle of identification, quantification, mitigation, and monitoring. The shared responsibility model in AWS requires clear understanding of which risks are managed by AWS (infrastructure, physical security, hypervisor) versus which risks remain with the customer (data, applications, access management, network configuration).

**This implementation plan addresses four core pillars:**

1. **Risk Discovery & Identification** — Systematic discovery of operational and business risks across AWS environments
2. **Risk Quantification & Prioritization** — Structured assessment methodologies to measure risk severity and business impact
3. **Risk Mitigation Strategy Development** — Creation of targeted remediation plans aligned to risk tolerance
4. **Continuous Risk Monitoring & Management** — Ongoing surveillance and adaptive response mechanisms

The methodology leverages AWS native services (AWS Security Hub, AWS Inspector, AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Config, Amazon GuardDuty) alongside established risk frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO 31000, FAIR) to create a comprehensive, scalable risk management program.
